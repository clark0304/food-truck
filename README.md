## Features

* We could have some-funny-discovery from the food truck list, such as food, shop distribution and loading cars, so let's go.

## Technical points

- [x] Composer [package](https://packagist.org/packages/clark0304/meet-the-challenge)
- [x] PHPUnit
- [x] automated script, document, annotation, demo & screenshot

* All of this work is to make our code more readable, easy to communicate and maintain.

## Get started

install:

```shell
composer require clark0304/food-truck
```
run:

```shell
php vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration=vendor/clark0304/food-truck/phpunit.xml
```

get:

```shell
some_funny_discovery.html
```

## To be better

* This list also has more deeper connections waiting for us to dig, such as chain brands, shops latitude and longitude...

* Data is like a treasure.
